# 3. Configure permissions for the job

    # 5. Set the environment for the job

    # 6. Define the sequence of steps
    steps:
      # Checks out your repository's code so the job can access it
      - name: Checkout

          cache: 'npm'

      # Installs the project dependencies

        run: npm install

      # Builds the project for production. The output will be in the 'dist' folder.

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build
        env:
          VITE_BASE_URL: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}/
