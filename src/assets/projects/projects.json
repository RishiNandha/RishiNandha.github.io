In 2018, Dr. Abhishek Kumar demonstrated this in 2.4 GHz over a 20 MHz bandwidth, I am extending this to show the same at 7 GHz with a 400 MHz bandwidth",

We explored beyond the course requirements and formulated a quantization-aware model that uses sigmoid weights directly instead of quantizing post-training",
        "description2": "Although limited by diminishing gradients for deeper networks, we found a significant reduction in quantization induced errors in relatively smaller networks. We've compared our results on the same dataset as used by Li et al in 2018 paper in the write-up below. We further explored stochastic training methods such simultaneous perturbation (SPSA) and annealing (SA) as alternatives for gradients.",

        "description2": "I guided two teams working on using deep learning models on wearables for assisting visually-impaired and auditorily-impaired individuals with independent mobility. During these projects, I got to see the real necessity of efficient edge-inference because with the current paradigm of using GPUs for inferencing, we were limited by the power budgets expendable. This reinforced my interest in exploring emerging paradigms such as In-Memory Computing.",
