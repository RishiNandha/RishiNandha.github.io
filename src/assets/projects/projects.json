In 2018, Dr. Abhishek Kumar demonstrated this in 2.4 GHz over a 20 MHz bandwidth, I am extending this to show the same at 7 GHz with a 400 MHz bandwidth",

Our TeraHertz system that establishes a point-to-point wireless link at 270 GHz was displayed at the Indian Mobile Congress 2024. I designed the Clock Rack (Seen at left bottom of the image) to provide referece clocks upto 100s of MHz for synchronizing our baseband units (BBUs) to GPS",

        "description": "As part of our coursework, we were tasked with training a 2-layer neural network, quantizing the weights to 1-bit post-training and inferencing them on a passive RRAM Synaptic Array. We explored beyond the course requirements and formulated a model that uses sigmoid weights directly to reflect the binary nature instead of quantizing post-training. Although limited by diminishing gradients for deeper networks, we found a significant reduction in quantization induced errors in relatively smaller networks. We further explored stochastic training methods such simultaneous perturbation (SPSA) and annealing (SA) as alternatives. We've compared our results on the same dataset as used by Li et al in 2018 paper in the write-up below",

Variational Fast-Forwarding is a pipeline introduced in 2020 to simulate atomic systems beyond coherence time on NISQ hardware. We reviewed the recent developments around this algorithm and contributed a dataset generator that can be utilized natively on quantum computing runtimes (Image adopted from Filip et al.)",
